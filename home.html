      <h2>Why Mental Health?</h2>
      <p>
        We are a team of three, and like many others, we have experienced the quiet challenges that come with mental health.
        Some of us have spent countless late nights scrolling through social media, searching for solace in words that never
        quite resonated. Others have carried unseen burdens, masking our struggles with smiles while battling inner turmoil.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we are not alone in this. Our generation is navigating unprecedented levels of stress, anxiety, and burnout. The
        constant pressure to perform, the expectation to always appear "okay," and the fear of being vulnerable—it all weighs
        heavily on us.
      <p>
        This platform wasn't born out of a mere good idea. It was born out of necessity. We created it because we needed a space
        where we could feel understood, supported, and safe. If we, as the creators, can find comfort and connection here, then
        perhaps—just perhaps—it can become a refuge for others who feel the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is more than just a platform; it's a community. A place where vulnerability is welcomed, where no one has to face their struggles alone, and where we can all find a little more peace, together.
